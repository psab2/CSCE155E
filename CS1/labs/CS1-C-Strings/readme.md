This lab introduces the use of strings in C.

## Prior to Lab

* Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
* Read the required chapters(s) of the textbook as
  outlined in the course schedule.

## Peer Programming Pair-Up

***For students in online section(s):*** you may complete
the lab on your own if you wish or you may team up with a partner
of your choosing, or, you may consult with a lab instructor to get
teamed up online (via Zoom).

***For students in the on campus section:*** your lab instructor
may team you up with a partner.  

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs are be
structured in a *peer programming* setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the *driver* and the other
the *navigator*.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is "in charge."  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week,
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

# Lab Objectives & Topics

At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following

-   Declare and print a string in C

-   Manipulate strings in a variety of ways

-   Use basic functions in the `string.h` library

# Background

Strings are collections of characters. In C, Strings are represented
using arrays of char values terminated by a special null-terminating
character, `\0`. Because they are arrays, the same precautions
must be made when working with strings as with general arrays. The
standard string library (`string.h`) provides many convenience
functions to manipulate and use strings.

This lab will familiarize you with some of these functions. In
particular, you will complete a program that implements a common
children's game, horse (also known as hangman). In this game, an English
word is chosen at random and its characters are hidden. The player takes
turns by guessing a letter; each instance (if any) of the guessed letter
is revealed. If the user is able to guess the word before a certain
number of guessed letters then they win. If they run out of guesses then
they lose.

Most of the game mechanics have been implemented for you. However, you
will need to complete the game by implementing several functions used by
the game to manipulate and compare strings.

# Activities

Clone the code for this lab from GitHub using the following URL:

## Implementing String Manipulation Functions

1.  Navigate to the `src` directory and open
    `gameFunctions.c` in the editor of your choice.

2.  There are several functions already fully implemented in this file.
    Your task for this lab is to implement the following four functions:

    -   `initializeBlankString()` - this function should take two
        arguments and return nothing:

        -   The first argument is an integer denoting the length of a
            string (not including the null terminator)

        -   The second argument should be a string

        -   The function should alter the passed string and set all of
            its characters to the underscore, `_` and properly
            null-terminate it

    -   `printWithSpaces()` - this function should take one argument
        and return nothing:

        -   The argument should be a string

        -   The function should print the contents of the string
            character-by-character with spaces between each one.

        -   Hint: use the `strlen()` function to find the length of
            the passed string)

    -   `revealGuessedLetter()` - this function should take three
        arguments and return an integer:

        -   The first argument will be the solution string (that should
            not be altered; use the `const` modifier to ensure that
            it is not)

        -   The second argument will be the (partially) revealed string
            that you will alter

        -   The third argument will be a single `char`, the letter
            guessed by the user in the game

        -   Iterate over each character in the second argument and
            "reveal" the letter if it matches the guessed letter

        -   For example, if the first string is `"dinosaur"` and the
            second is `"________"` and the character passed is
            `a`, then the function should alter the second string so
            that it becomes `"_____a__"`.

        -   You may assume that the strings are of equal length.

        -   The function should return a 1 if any letters were changed
            in the second string and 0 otherwise.

    -   `checkGuess()` - this function should take two strings as
        input and return an integer.

        -   If the two strings are equivalent, return a 1 from the
            function. If they are different, return a 0.

        -   Hint: make use the `strcmp()` function from the string
            library.

3.  Navigate to the `include` directory and open
    `gameFunctions.h` in the editor of your choice

4.  Complete the function prototypes that you implemented in
    `gameFunctions.c` here.

##Handin/Grader Instructions

1.  Hand in your completed files:

    -   `gameFunctions.c`

    -   `gameFunctions.h`

    and verify your program compiles and all tests pass.
    For this lab the grader will simulate playing several games (some
    intentionally losing, some winning). Each run may be slightly
    different but the output should correctly display the game being
    played.

2.  Even if you worked with a partner, you *both* should turn in all
    files.

# Advanced Activity (Optional)

Currently, the game has a strict limitation on the number and length of
words a user can enter in the `dictionary.txt` file. Alter the
program so that it can accept any number of words and words of any
length from `dictionary.txt` (hint: you'll need to dynamically
allocate the memory for the array in `main.c`, among other
changes in `gameFunctions.h` and `gameFunctions.c`).
