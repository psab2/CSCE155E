[College of Engineering](https://engineering.unl.edu/) at the
[University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

## 1. Overview

### Prior to Lab

Before attending this lab:

1.  Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.

2.  Read Chapters 12 and 25 of the [Computer Science
    I](http://cse.unl.edu/~cbourke/ComputerScienceOne.pdf) textbook

3.  Watch Videos 13.1 thru 13.7 of the [Computer Science
    I](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4IH6CVPpTZVkiEnCEOdGbYsFEdtKc5Bx)
    video series

### Peer Programming Pair-Up

**For students in the online section:** you may complete the lab on your
own if you wish or you may team up with a partner of your choosing.  You
may consult with a lab instructor to get teamed up online (via Zoom).

**For students in the face-to-face section:** your lab instructor will
team you up with a partner.

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs are be
structured in a *peer programming* setup. At the start of each lab, you
will be randomly paired up with another student (conflicts such as
absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor). One of you will be
designated the *driver* and the other the *navigator*.

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next. The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation. Both driver and navigator are responsible for
suggesting fixes and solutions together. Neither the navigator nor the
driver is "in charge." Beyond your immediate pairing, you are encouraged
to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week, be a
navigator next, etc. Resolve any issues (you were both drivers last
week) within your pair. Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues only
when you cannot come to a consensus.

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab. Failure to do so will
negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with others which
may mean that you will not be able to complete the lab.

### Lab Objectives & Topics

At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following

-   Understand basic searching and sorting algorithms

-   Understand how comparator functions work and their purpose

-   How to leverage standard search and sort algorithms built into a
    framework

## 2. Background

Recursion has been utilized in several searching and sorting algorithms.
In particular, quicksort and binary search both can be implemented using
recursive functions. The quicksort algorithm works by choosing a pivot
element and dividing a list into two sub-lists consisting of elements
smaller than the pivot and elements that are larger than the pivot (ties
can be broken either way). A recursive quicksort function can then be
recursively called on each sub-list until a base case is reached: when
the list to be sorted is of size 1 or 0 which, by definition, is already
sorted.

Binary search can also be implemented in a recursive manner. Given a
sorted array and a key to be searched for in the array, we can examine
the middle element in the array. If the key is less than the middle
element, we can recursively call the binary search function on the
sub-list of all elements to the left of the middle element. If the key
is greater than the middle element, we recursively call the binary
search function on the sub-list of all elements to the right of the
middle element.

Searching and sorting are two solved problems. That is, most languages
and frameworks offer built-in functionality or standard implementations
in their standard libraries to facilitate searching and sorting through
collections. These implementations have been optimized, debugged and
tested beyond anything that a single person could ever hope to
accomplish. Thus, there is rarely ever a good justification for
implementing your own searching and sorting methods. Instead, it is far
more important to understand how to leverage the framework and utilize
the functionality that it already provides.

## 3. Activities

Clone the project code for this lab from GitHub using the following URL:
<https://github.com/cbourke/CSCE155-C-Lab13>

### 3.1 Sorting the Wrong Way

In this activity, you will implement a selection sort algorithm to
sort an array of structures. Refer to lecture notes, your text, or any
online source on how to implement the selection sort algorithm. The
order by which you will sort the array will be according to the total
team payroll (in dollars).

#### Instructions

1.  Familiarize yourself with the `Team` structure and the functions provided
    to you (the program automatically loads the data from the CSV file
    and provides an array of teams).

2.  Implement the `selectionSortTeamsByPayroll` function in the `team.c`
    file as specified by the header (`team.h`) documentation.

3.  Compile and run your program (use make which produces an executable
    called `mlbDriver`) and verify the results.

### 3.2 Slightly Better Sorting

The `Team` structure has many different data fields; wins, losses (and win
percentage), team name, city, state, payroll, average salary. Suppose that
we wanted to re-sort teams according to one of these fields in either
ascending or descending order (or even some combination of fields?
state/city for example). Doing it the wrong way as above we would need
to implement no less than 16 different sort functions!

Most of the code would be the same though.  Only the criteria on which we
update the index of the minimum element would differ. Instead, it would
be better to implement one sorting function and make it configurable:
provide a means by which the function can determine the relative
ordering of any two elements. The way of doing this in C is to define a
*comparator function*.

Comparator functions *must* have the following signature:

`int cmp(const void *a, const void *b);`

Such a function takes two arguments `a` and `b` (specified by generic
void pointers) and returns an integer with the following "contract":
it returns

-   A negative value if `a < b`

-   Zero if `a` is equal to `b`

-   A positive value if `a > b`

Several examples have been provided for comparing structures based on
several different criteria. The usual pattern is to cast the arguments
to the expected types, then to examine the relevant field(s) and return
a result that orders the two teams appropriately.

#### Instructions

1.  Implement the `selectionSortTeams` function by using the code
    in Activity 1 with appropriate modifications (use the provided
    `compar` function to find the minimum element each time)

2.  Look at the comparator functions provided to you and to the bubble
    sort algorithm example on how you might use a comparator function

3.  Implement your own comparator function that orders `Team`s according to
    the total payroll in decreasing order.

4.  Use your comparator in the program to call your function.

### 3.3. Sorting the Right Way

The better way of doing this is to leverage the standard C libraryâ€™s
sorting function. The signature of this function is as follows:

```c
void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size,
    int(*compar)(const void *, const void *));
```

where

-   `base` is the array to be sorted

-   `nmemb` is the number of elements in the array

-   `size` is the size of each element (use `sizeof()`)

-   `compar` is a comparator function pointer

#### Instructions

1.  Examine the source files and observe how comparator functions are
    implemented and how the `qsort` function is called.

2.  Implement your own comparator function that orders `Team`s according
    to payroll in *increasing order*.

3.  Use your function in the `main` program to re-sort the
    array and print out the results.

### 3.4. Searching

The standard C library offers several search functions. The two that we
will focus on are as follows.

-   `lfind` a linear search implementation that does not require the array to
    be sorted. The function works by iterating through the array and
    calling your comparator function on the provided key. It returns the
    first instance such that the comparator returns zero (equal).

-   `bsearch` a binary search implementation that requires the array to be
    sorted according to the same comparator used to search.

Both functions require a comparator function (as used in sorting) and a
key upon which to search. A key is a "dummy" instance of the same type
as the array that contains values of fields that you're searching for.

### Instructions

1.  Examine the searching code segment in the `mlbDriver.c` file and
    understand how each function is called.

2.  Observe that each of the 4 searches have *different* results.
    Discuss with your partner (or yourself) why this is the case.

3.  Based on your observations add code to search the array for the team
    representing the Chicago Cubs.

    1.  Create a dummy `Team` key for the Cubs by using the `initTeam`
        function using empty strings and zero values except for the team
        name (which should be `"Cubs"`).

    2.  Sort the array by team name by calling `qsort` using the appropriate
        comparator function.

    3.  Call the `bsearch` function using your key and the appropriate comparator
        function to find the `Team` representing the Chicago Cubs.

    4.  Print out the team by using the `printTeam` function.

4.  Examine your output and compare it to the `data/expectedOutput.txt` file;
    fix any errors before you submit.

5.  Discuss with your partner: why were all the search results for
    a California (CA) team different?

## 4. Handin/Grader Instructions

1.  Hand in your completed files:

    - `team.h`
    - `team.c`
    - `mlbDriver.c`

2.  Even if you worked with a partner, you *both* should turn in all
    files.


## Advanced Activity (Optional)

Selection sort is a quadratic sorting algorithm, thus doubling the input
size ($n$ elements to $2n$ elements) leads to a blowup in its execution
time by a factor of 4. Quick sort requires only $n\log{(n)}$ operations on
average, so doubling the input size would only lead (roughly) to a
blowup in execution time by a factor of about 2. Verify this theoretical
analysis by setting up an experiment to time each sorting algorithm on
various input sizes of randomly generated integer arrays. Make use of
the time library's functions to time the execution of your function
calls.
